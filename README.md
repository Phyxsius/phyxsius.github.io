Personal website/blog to follow my different aspects of development. Also gives me the opportunity to play around with new (or new to me) web technologies including [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), [AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml), [MDL](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite), etc.
