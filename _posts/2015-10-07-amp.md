One of my main goals with web projects is to make them as light and as quick as possible. I've tried optimizing this page as much as I can, offloading resources like CSS and JS to load after the initial page load to speed things up. So when I heard that the AMP Project team was releasing Accelerated Mobile Pages to the world, I quickly jumped on board to test.

Luckily for me, this page is pretty simple. Just throw the **âš¡** symbol in the HTML tag, changed my viewport tag to include a few more options, add the async JS file and styling and I was up and running. I use background images for the post images so those didn't need editing (or not yet) but I do load my author icon as a simple ```<img>``` tag so that had to be updated to the new ```<amp-img></amp-img>```. But so far so good. I see some errors are being thrown when I view with the development flag, so I will read into that more, but it's functional.

One step closer to a faster web. I'm excited.
