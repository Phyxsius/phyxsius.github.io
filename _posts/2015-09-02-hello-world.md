================

<p>Sept 2, 2015</p>

My goal is for this page to be constantly evolving. A chance to play around with everything new and anything else I can't use, for whatever reason, with this page (Django projects, Laravel, learning new databases, etc) I will try and post about. That way I can see how far I've come in areas.

I have a personal website that I host but it's running off an older Synology NAS that I had to hack around on to use any of the newer technologies I wanted to play with and it's a bit frustrating to keep up on. I have some ideas for it eventually but for the time being I think I'm going to use this page as my main blog. Plus, it gives me a chance to learn and play around with Jekyll and start fresh. Not sure what I'll do with this in terms of design but I was thinking of using web components and Polymer.

**Here's to adventure.**
